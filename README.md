# Student Grade Management System
A comprehensive console-based grade management system built with C# that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, and loops. Perfect for learning C# programming fundamentals while building a practical application.
📖 About
The Student Grade Management System is an educational project designed to demonstrate the practical application of fundamental C# programming concepts. This system allows users to manage student grades efficiently through a simple, menu-driven console interface.
Learning Objectives:

Understand and implement variables and data types in C#
Master the use of operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
Apply conditional statements (if, else if, switch) for decision-making
Utilize loops (for, while, do-while) for repetitive tasks
Work with arrays and Lists for data storage
Implement statistical calculations and data analysis
Learn C# syntax and .NET framework basics

This project serves as an excellent starting point for beginners learning C# programming fundamentals while creating a real-world application.
